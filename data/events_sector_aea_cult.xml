When Ivar sees the truth and joins the Coalition, your hypocritical leaders will be annihilated! And until then, we'll have to make do with picking off you intrusive Universe 0 Renegades!"</text>
	<text>Following the Federation-Mantis war, it was agreed during the Kadahellian'ek Treaty that the Gathering and Confederacy would never enter war against each other. Despite this, tensions remain high, and it seems many Vampweeds still hold history against the Federation. One particularly radical vessel nearby locks onto you!.</text>
	<text>Vampweeds might not be your friends, but it's not too typical for them to act in such aggressive manners. However, scans show the crew of the nearby ship have succumbed to some kind of parasite that creates irrational behavior. Prepare to fight!.</text>
	<text>"And so it's true, the Federation has finally sent Renegades to renew the old war! Well, we won't take this insult without a fight, scum!" Unfortunately, the ship refuses to listen to you, meaning a fight is inevitable.</text>
	<text>A drunk Vampweed factory worker's vessel lurches towards you. "Ehhh... dumbass... Feds in my sector? You'll regret this, hear me!" Despite barely being able to form a coherent sentence, the captain is able to order his crew to attack!.</text>
	<text>Vampweeds are known to drink a fair bit as a culture, and intoxicated Orchids aren't an uncommon sight here. Unfortunately, the side effects of heavy drinking tend to cause irrational decisions, such as engaging Renegades in combat!.</text>
	<text>"I didn't side with the Hive during the old war, but now? Now I think I should have! The Federation has done nothing but push us away when we needed it most, and you're going to regret that!"</text>
