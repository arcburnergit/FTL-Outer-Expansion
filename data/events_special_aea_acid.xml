	<text>The Acidic Growth is a relatively unknown faction. However, what isn't unknown is how dangerous it is.</text>
	<text>This nebula is home to the Acidic Growth. It's still unknown whether it's a singular almost omnipresent entity or a hive mind of sorts, but you probably don't wanna be on their bad side.</text>
	<text>You're told the Acidic Growth has expanded into this nebula. Unfortunately, only the orchids are welcome in Acidic space.</text>
	<text>Not much is known about how the Acidic Growth lives and spends its time. Perhaps you'll find out. Question is, if you'll be lucky enough to survive and tell the tale.</text>
	<text>The Acidic Growth formed within a nebula like this. Although able to survive naked in the nebula, the Acidic Growth has created its own ships and technology in order to interact with the wider universe.</text>
