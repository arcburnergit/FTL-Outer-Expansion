	<preventQuest />
	<text>our sensors spot a Lylmik autoship signature. It seems to have been accelerating in the same direction for a very long time and accumulated a tremendous amount of speed as a result. You're not sure whether this is some sort of experiment with regard to the viability of sublight travel or simply a malfunction, but a much more pressing issue is that your ship just happened to drop out of hyperspace right in its path.</text>
	<choice hidden="true">
		<text>Brace for impact!.</text>
		<event>
			<text>Out of all the ships to collide with at high speed, a Lylmik-made one was probably the worst possible outcome, what with their love of heavy armor plating. The sheer mass of the deceptively small autoship sends your vessel careening through space as you black out. Once everyone comes to their senses, the damage report reveals many gaping holes in the hull from the impact. It's a miracle no one fell through one of them.</text>

			<text>The Lylmik's ships are known for their very effective armor, but every ship has its weak spot. A few well aimed shots manage to knock down some thrusters, throwing the autoship out of alignment, and the subsequent barrage from your weapons convert the out of control vessel into a cloud of scrap, which you harvest.</text>

	<text>It's clear the ship moving in to attack you has only survived so long from being incredibly dangerous.</text>
	<text>The only way to survive trapped in this section of the Multiverse is to take resources from others, and theres a survivor approaching you now.</text>
	<text>Although against killing themselves, the Lylmik do nothing about keeping citizens of their realm from killing each other. As it happens a citizen moving into an attack position.</text>
