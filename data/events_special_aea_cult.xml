	<text>The Vampweeds are hardcore industrialists, capitalists, and democrats. The only truly democratic nation without a voice in the Federation, many Confederates have felt discriminated against and look to the Coalition as a solution. Expect to see as many hostiles as you do friendly faces.</text>
	<text>The Gathering has long since been protesting against the Confederacy joining the Federation, but still Premier Ivar pushes for unification. With Confederates now divided between the Federation and the Coalition, this may be an unusual mix of allies and enemies for you.</text>
	<text>Confederate sectors are some of the most industrialized in the galaxy. With most heavy manufacturing now done by the Vampweeds, the economy of these sectors is soaring and draws the attention of many merchants. Unfortunately, regional politics have drawn the attention of Coalition recruiters too. Keep a sharp eye out for friends and enemies.</text>

	<text>The halls of the once lively vampweed vessel are now as silent as the living members of their Floral brethren. Perhaps there's something poetic to this, but you're here for scrap and not deeper meanings.</text>
	<text>"I'm not a religious man, that's a greenleaf's thing... but when you're taking your last breath, it's a rather spiritual moment. God... I hope there isn't a hell..."</text>
	<text>As you board the AEA_CULT vessel to scrap it, you find various propaganda and paraphernalia relating to the Coalition and the Confederacy. These guys were apparently radicals and nationalists, but in a court of law, you aren't sure that would hold as a defense on its own.</text>

	<text>Out of breath, the vampweed captain's petals are a bit singed at the tips. "If the Federation... truly represents peace as it claims... then I hope you will find it in you to spare me... despite my mistakes here today."</text>
	<text>"You can't kill me, I'm a valued member of the industrial work force! If I'm not there screwing the cap onto every Kardoche fertilizer bottle, then who else will?!"</text>
	<text>The vampweed nods to you. "I... apologize for my rash behavior. I have made an ill decision in fighting you. This is the kind of behavior that caused the old war. I hope you have it in your heart to forgive me."</text>
	<text>The Confederate captain falls to his knees, begging you for mercy. He apologizes on behalf of his entire species for their past mistakes and offers you all of this month's wages at his factory job in return for sparing him.</text>
