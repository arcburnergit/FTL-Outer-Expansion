	<text>"A long time ago, before your federation, or rebellion there was just us, the Lylmiks. We expanded across the multiverse asserting our dominance over the other races, however as time went on our control became less effective and we started to lose. We started losing control over parts of the multiverse, the races we held under our thumb for so long began to band together and attack us."</text>

The otherside wanted the opposite, they wanted to redouble our efforts to control the multiverse."</text>

Although we had rendered ourselves almost immortal, both sides took the time to develop weapons capable of ripping each other out of the multiverse.

During the conflict major leaps in innovation were developped around Multiversal travel. One of those was the ability to quarantine certain realities. It was decided by the Lylmik council, the leaders of the Lylmik during the war, that we should quarantine ourselves, many of our species just wanted to be done with the multiverse."</text>
