	<choice hidden="true">
		<text>Visit the museum.</text>
		<event>
			<text>The first exhibit covers first design of the Central Engineering Facility, the Twin Drone.
"The Twin Drone is a modification of the standard combat drone. Gi engineers noticed the inability for some combat drones to penetrate the protective shield layers of an enemy ship. Gi engineers developped an attachement for the drone, a small and weak ion cannon, sufficient enough to ionize shield, but not any more. The biggest drawback of the drone was that the power source of the drone wasn't designed to power two weapons at once, and as such was slowed down by the additional weapon."</text>
			<choice hidden="true">
				<text>Move onto the next exhibit.</text>
				<event>
					<text>The next exhibit covers the Burst Drone.
"The Burst Drone was the first design native to the facility. The drone was designed around an adaptive power supply, this power supply was able to greatly increase the potency of the weapon, but increasing the power still reduced the speed of the drone. The drone is still very power efficient and these developments in drone reactor design lead to further developments."</text>
					<choice hidden="true">
						<text>Move onto the next exhibit.</text>
						<event>
							<text>The next exhibit covers the Intel Drone.
"The Intel Drone was a leap forwards in a different area of drone design. The Intelligence drone incorporates a brand new AI module, this greately increased the potency of the drone by allowing it to target important components on the enemy ship, increasing the reliablility of the damage. The drone also incorporates some of the previous advancements in drone reactor design and as such is able to power two laser cannons at once."</text>
							<choice hidden="true">
								<text>Move onto the final exhibit.</text>
								<event>
									<text>The final exhibit covers the Bio Drone.
"The Bio Drone is the most modern development in drone designs by this facility. One of the advancements in this drone incorporates the AI module of the Intel drone, however this time the AI has been adjusted to target enemy crew, this greately increases the effectiveness of the weapon. This leads onto the next development, the weapon on this drone series incorporates a powerful bio laser that causes the target to detonate on death, causing damage to the immediate area."</text>
